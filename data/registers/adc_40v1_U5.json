The conversion result can be read from in the DR (regular conversion) or from in the JDRyi registers (injected conversion). When OFFSETy[21:0] bitfield is reset, the offset compensation is disabled. Note: The software is allowed to write these bits only when ADSTART = 0 and JADSTART = 0 (which ensures that no conversion is ongoing). If several offsets (OFFSETy) point to the same channel, only the offset with the lowest y value is considered for the subtraction. For example, if OFFSET1_CH[4:0] = 4 and OFFSET2_CH[4:0] = 4, this is OFFSET1[25:0] that is subtracted when converting channel 4.",
